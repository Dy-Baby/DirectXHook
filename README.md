# DirectX11Hook
This DirectX hook can take control of the DirectX 11 renderer in 3D games and applications. The hook should work for most games and can be built for both 32-bit and 64-bit. **Still under active development, but all the core parts work.** 

Below is a video of the hook hooking the renderer in Monster Hunter World.

I'll be adding proper documentation at some point, working on other stuff.

Tested in:
Monster Hunter World, Kenshi, Witcher 3, Divinity Original Sin 2, Metro 2033, etc.
